# Minimal Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project goal is to have a place to display current data that I can provide, by using it as a template. This would mean that customizing would be easier , just need to change template, or data. No need to go around the code just to change a few things

## Specs
* Minimal - just Personal description, social links , and project list
* Responsive

## Inspiration / Resources
* A link to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Qgl3yy79babLPCkwm3o4Nc/Minimal-Personal-Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1) I created
