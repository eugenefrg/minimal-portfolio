# Minimal Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project goal is to have a place to display current data that I can provide, by using it as a template. This would mean that customizing would be easier , just need to change template, or data. No need to go around the code just to change a few things

## Current Specs
* Minimal - just Personal description, social links , and project list

## To Do
* Responsive Design - for now it will only work for desktop.
